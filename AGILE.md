Agile Methodology
==============

### What is Agile?
Agile development is a mindset whose values and principles provide guidance on how to create and respond to change and how to deal with uncertainty.
It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and turbulent environment. It's really about thinking through how you can understand what's going on in the environment that you're in today, identify what uncertainty you're facing, and figure out how you can adopt to that as you go along.

So, as the task assigned us to build a **Microsoft Teams Clone** 
Microsoft Teams is not a small application nowdays there is lot going beyond just organising the meetings and webinars. We are ask to build our product in a month with minimum requirement that two people should be able to do a video call conversation but in real scenario the case is not similar we want to build something which can beat current application but the whole project is going to take one or two year but in this time the app will gain more features because we are living in changing environment.
*MS Teams one year before is way different from what it is now*


So, If you want a application as a client and developer says they will deliver the product in a year that's very big time and you want your product instantly so we know about the concept **Software Development Life Cycle** and one of the famous methodolgy we use is **Waterfall Model** so in this whenever we want to make a software we follow some steps
<ul>
  <li>Requirement and Analysis</li>
  <li>Design</li>
  <li>Code</li>
  <li>Test</li>
  <li>Deploy</li>
  <li>Maintain</li>
</ul>
So, what happens in waterfall after you switch a phase you cannot go back so if client want to add some new feature it's not possible that is changes are not welcomed in later phase of the process.

##### Waterfall has some issue
<ul>
  <li><b>The time to market is very slow</b></li>
  <p>If you want to build a software now it's going to take some time to build the entire software and the market is somewhere else in that span of time so if you want to build your app start with the small and important feature now.</p>
  <li><b>Very difficult if client want some changes in between</b></li>
  <p>So, if you have to understand your client as well as market, because market is changing very fast and if client is investing his money he want something which can beat market so you have to accept client changes.</p>
</ul>
