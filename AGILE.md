Agile Methodology
==============

### What is Agile?
Agile development is a mindset whose values and principles provide guidance on how to create and respond to change and how to deal with uncertainty.
It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and turbulent environment. It's really about thinking through how you can understand what's going on in the environment that you're in today, identify what uncertainty you're facing, and figure out how you can adopt to that as you go along.
