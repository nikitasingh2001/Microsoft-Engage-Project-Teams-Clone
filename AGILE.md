Agile Methodology
==============

### What is Agile?
Agile development is a mindset whose values and principles provide guidance on how to create and respond to change and how to deal with uncertainty.
It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and turbulent environment. It's really about thinking through how you can understand what's going on in the environment that you're in today, identify what uncertainty you're facing, and figure out how you can adopt to that as you go along.

`Trending thing now a days is IT industry create a solution and you will earn money`

So, as the task assigned us is to build a **Microsoft Teams Clone** 
Microsoft Teams is not a small application nowdays there is lot going beyond just organising the meetings and webinars. We are ask to build our product in a month with minimum requirement that two people should be able to do a video call conversation but in real scenario the case is not similar we want to build something which can beat current application but the whole project is going to take one or two year but in this time the app will gain more features because we are living in changing environment.
*MS Teams one year before is way different from what it is now*


So, If you want a application as a client and developer says they will deliver the product in a year that's very big time and you want your product instantly so we know about the concept **Software Development Life Cycle** and one of the famous methodolgy we use is **Waterfall Model** so in this whenever we want to make a software we follow some steps
<ul>
  <li>Requirement and Analysis</li>
  <li>Design</li>
  <li>Code</li>
  <li>Test</li>
  <li>Deploy</li>
  <li>Maintain</li>
</ul>
So, what happens in waterfall after you switch a phase you cannot go back so if client want to add some new feature it's not possible that is changes are not welcomed in later phase of the process.

#### Waterfall has some issues
<ul>
  <li><b>The time to market is very slow</b></li>
  <p>If you want to build a software now it's going to take some time to build the entire software and the market is somewhere else in that span of time so if you want to build your app start with the small and important feature now.</p>
  <li><b>Very difficult if client want some changes in between</b></li>
  <p>So, if you have to understand your client as well as market, because market is changing very fast and if client is investing his money he want something which can beat market so you have to accept client changes.</p>
</ul>

## How the issues of Waterfall Method are solved??
To solve this problem a new philosophy is given named **Agile** 
They had given a manifesto and it's your choice how you want to implement this there are multiple ways to implement agile `Scrum`, `KANBAN` , `XP`.

They had given 12 principles and 4 values so if you are following those you are doing agile. So, if you really want to make good software **Be Agile**.

<ul>
  <li><p>You should give more importance to individual and interaction because software are build by individuals so you need to give them importance</p></li>
  <li><p>We want a working software which works properly not the documentation which teach how to fix that issue</p></li>
  <li><p>There should be proper communication between you and customer</p></li>
  <li><p>You should welcome changes even in the end because in the initial phase client also did not know what he want so you start building with MVP(Minimum Viable Product)</p></li>
  
 So, you can read more about these principles here https://agilemanifesto.org/

We all know if we want to make modern software in this world we cannot directly go for waterfall model. One of the framework by which we can implement agile is `SCRUM` we have other options to but widely used framework is SCRUM.
  
## SCRUM
### A better way of building products.
<ul>
  <li>Lightweight</li>
  <li>Easy to implement</li>
  <li>Difficult to master</li>
</ul>
  
### Scrum Framework

## How I implemented agile methodology using Scrum framework??
So, we have to build a product like MS-Teams clone in our case so we know that MS-Teams have so many features. So, we priortize some requirement like in our case is to build a minimum requirement for qualifying that was to build a functional prototype in which two people can have video conversation with each other and then we start working on product but if you make use of scrum it normally goes with sprints. So, as in our case to complete the task we have one-month but our client or to be more specific our mentor will not be waiting for entire month to deliver this so what we can do is to give something which is potentially deployable product. So, to implement this what we will do we take some important requirement for a particular sprint(which is 1 week in my case).
  
Now, we have product backlog which have all the requirements from start of the project to the end but agile allows us to make changes even in later phase of development so it's not fixed. So, we will take some backlog that is going to be sprint backlog but before this you need to plan well so in the upcoming week you will work on that particular part. And after completion of each sprint we give increment that is **potentially deployable product** to our mentors but it may happen that in particular week you are not able to complete all which you have decided for that particular sprint so you can send that backlog for next week with some other feature but before the start of next sprint you are going to have sprint retrospective that is discussion with mentors what you are able to achieve?, What are your backlogs? , What are you plans for next week?

**Here, below in table I have summarised how my scrum board looks like for this project which briefly describes about my backlogs, my plans for next week, how much I was able to achieve**
  
**For the first two weeks-**

**For the next two weeks-**

So, all the participants are actually going to thank microsoft because not only just keep working on task which we were assigned we also got a chance to experience the **adopt stage** of agile.
So, basically what happened that in the last week of this project we were assigned a new task that was like we need to adopt with changes that as a client they are demanding from us to add a new feature in our prototype that was to build a Chat App.
As, we were following agile methodology we were able to achieve this easily even in later phase of the development of project.
 
## So, this is how I applied the agile methodology while creating the solution for the challenge assigned to us.
### Be Agile!!
